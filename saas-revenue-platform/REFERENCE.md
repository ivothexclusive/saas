## Problem Statement

### Situation
Service businesses get 20-100+ calls per month. Each call has potential value ($500-$5K+ per deal).

### Complication
- **No visibility:** Don't know how many calls came in or where from
- **Lost deals:** Miss callbacks, slow follow-up, leads go cold
- **Hidden ROI:** Can't prove that marketing spend → calls → revenue
- **Manual work:** Repetitive follow-ups, scheduling, data entry
- **No optimization:** Don't know which marketing channels actually work

### Resolution
A single platform that:
1. **Captures** every inbound call (tracking, source, duration, outcome)
2. **Shows** real-time dashboard (calls today, revenue per call, missed opportunities)
3. **Automates** follow-up (SMS, email, calls) and booking
4. **Attributes** revenue (links calls → booked appointments → closed deals)
5. **Optimizes** with AI (best times to call, follow-up patterns, highest-ROI channels)
