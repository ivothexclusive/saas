## Phase 1: Months 1-3 (Pre-Launch to First Customers)

### Goal: Find and close 3-5 paying customers

### 1.1 Direct Outreach (Manual + High-Touch)

**Timeline:** Start in Week 1, ongoing

**Strategy:** Personal emails + LinkedIn messages to target customers

**Target List Construction:**
1. Build list of 100-200 target customers:
   - HVAC companies (search: "hvac contractors near [city]" on Google Maps)
   - Real estate teams (LinkedIn search: "real estate broker," "real estate team")
   - Medical clinics (search: "[specialty] clinics near [city]")
   - Legal firms (LinkedIn: "law firm partners")

**Tools to use:**
- Clay.com or Apollo.io (find emails, phone numbers)
- Hunter.io (email finder)
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (target by role + industry)

**Outreach Template (Email):**

```
Subject: $4K/month in lost revenue (for HVAC: "HVAC Leads You're Missing")

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How many calls do you get per month that you don't follow up on?

For [Company], we noticed [Company similar to theirs] was losing ~$4K/month in missed callbacks.

We built a simple dashboard that tracks every call and automates follow-up. Within 2 weeks, they recovered that $4K.

If you're curious to see if you have similar leaks, I'd love to show you. Takes 20 minutes.

[Your company name]
```

**Key elements:**
- Specific problem ($4K/month)
- Social proof (similar company)
- Time commitment (20 min)
- Easy CTA (calendar link)

**Expected results:**
- 2-5% response rate = 2-10 responses per 100 emails
- 30-50% of responses book a call = 1-5 demo calls per batch
- 40-60% of demos convert to trial = 1-3 trials per batch
- 25% of trials convert to paid = 0-1 paying customer per batch

**Cadence:** Send 10 emails/day (don't spam), follow up after 5 days if no response

**First Month Target:** Close 1 customer

---

### 1.2 LinkedIn Content Strategy

**Timeline:** Start in Week 1, 3-4 posts/week

**Goal:** Build authority, establish differentiation, generate inbound interest

**Content Ideas:**

#### Post Type 1: Problem Posts (Ask questions, showcase pain)
- "How much revenue does your business lose when someone doesn't call you back?" (HVAC example)
- "Real estate teams: What's your callback response time? If it's >2 hours, you're losing deals."
- "Medical clinics: How long does it take from call to appointment confirmation?"

**Format:** 3-5 sentences, ask for engagement, simple hook

**Example:**
> "HVAC companies get 50+ calls per month. But how many turn into jobs?
> 
> We helped a Chicago HVAC company realize they were losing $4K/month on missed callbacks.
> 
> How many high-value calls are you leaving on the table?
> 
> Thread below with 3 quick questions to find out 👇"

#### Post Type 2: Data/Insight Posts (Share real data)
- "We analyzed 500 service business calls. Here's what we found..."
- "Real estate teams that respond to leads within 1 hour close 40% more deals"
- "Missed call recovery: Here's how one clinic went from 20% callback rate to 95%"

**Format:** Insight + stat + implication

**Example:**
> "We reviewed 500+ inbound calls for service businesses.
> 
> The results shocked us:
> • 23% of calls go to voicemail (never called back)
> • Of those, only 15% ever hear back from the business
> • Average value of a missed call: $1,200+
> 
> That's ~$275K in annual lost revenue per business.
> 
> The fix? Simple automation + follow-up rules. Nothing fancy.
> 
> #ServiceBusiness #Revenue #SmallBusiness"

#### Post Type 3: Case Study Posts (Social proof)
- "We helped [Company] recover $4K/month in lost revenue in 2 weeks"
- "How one real estate team went from 50% callback rate to 95%"
- "[Clinic] upsold 3 new services because they finally knew call revenue"

**Format:** Challenge + solution + result + quote

**Example:**
> "📞 Case Study: [HVAC Company] in Chicago
> 
> Challenge: 60 calls/month but no idea which ones turned into $$$
> 
> Solution: We installed our call tracking + auto-follow-up system
> 
> Results:
> ✅ Recovered $4K/month in missed callbacks
> ✅ Saved team 8 hrs/week on manual follow-ups
> ✅ Increased marketing ROI visibility by 40%
> 
> Quote: 'We were losing money we didn't even know about. This made it impossible to ignore.'
> 
> [Link to case study]"

#### Post Type 4: Thread Posts (Deep dives, educational)
- "5-part thread: How to prove your marketing ROI (even if you're tracking calls manually)"
- "Why most service businesses fail at automation (and how to fix it)"

**Format:** Hook (1-2 sentences) → 5-7 detailed points → CTA

**Posting schedule:**
- Monday: Problem post (engagement booster)
- Wednesday: Insight post (credibility)
- Friday: Case study post (social proof)
- Optional bonus: Thursday thread (deep value)

**Engagement tactics:**
- Reply to every comment within 2 hours
- Ask questions in comments to drive discussion
- Tag relevant communities (e.g., HVAC groups, real estate groups)
- Share others' content (build reciprocity)

**Expected results:**
- 100+ followers in Month 1
- 10-20% engagement rate (likes + comments)
- 3-5 inbound DMs/week asking about product
- 1-2 demo requests from LinkedIn

---

### 1.3 Cold LinkedIn DMs + Outreach

**Timeline:** Week 1 onwards

**Strategy:** Personalized 1-on-1 messages to decision makers (owners, sales managers)

**Message Template:**

```
Hi [Name],

Saw you're running [Company]. Quick question—how are you tracking ROI on your [Google/Facebook] ads?

For most service businesses, it's guesswork. But one HVAC owner we talked to realized they were losing $4K/month just from missed callbacks.

We built a simple platform to show exactly where that money is going (and how to recover it).

Curious if that's a problem for you? Happy to show you in 20 minutes.

### LTV:CAC Ratio
