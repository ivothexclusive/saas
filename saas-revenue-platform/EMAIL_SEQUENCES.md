Hi [Name],

Great meeting you yesterday!

Based on our conversation, I put together a custom proposal for your business:

**Your Opportunity:**
• Est. [X] calls/month generating ~$[Y] in potential revenue
• Current recovery rate: [Z]%
• With RevenueLock: estimated recovery to [Z+40]%
• **Potential added revenue: $[monthly recovery]**

**Recommendation:**
Start with Tier 2 ($2,000/mo) for 3 months:
✓ Call tracking + attribution
✓ SMS follow-up automation
✓ Booking integration
✓ Team access

**Investment vs. ROI:**
Month 1: $2,000 investment → ~$[recovery] recovered = [X]% ROI
Month 2-3: Profit

**Next Steps:**
1. Try 14-day free trial
2. Or jump straight to Tier 2 (we'll set you up personally)

### Email 4 (Day 3 After Demo, No Response)
**Subject:** [Name], Still Interested? [Let's Make This Easy]

```
Hi [Name],

Just following up on yesterday's proposal.

No pressure at all — I know decisions take time.

But I want to make sure you have what you need:

**If you're ready:** Start here → [Free Trial Link]

**If you have questions:** Let's jump on a quick call → [Calendar]

**If it's not the right time:** No worries! I'll check back in a month.

The biggest regret I hear from businesses is "I wish I started tracking revenue sooner."

Looking forward to working together.

## SEQUENCE 3: Email Outreach (Cold)

### Trigger: Manual send or automated from prospect list

### Email 1 (Initial Outreach)
**Subject:** $4K/month you're missing (for [Company])

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How many calls does [Company] get per month that don't get followed up?

For most [INDUSTRY] businesses, it's more than they think.

We helped a [similar company] realize they were losing ~$4K/month in missed callbacks and lost deals.

If you're curious whether [Company] has similar leaks, I'd love to show you. Takes 20 minutes.

### Email 2 (Day 5, No Response)

```
Hi [Name],

Just following up on my last email (no pressure if it didn't land).

Quick reality check: Most [INDUSTRY] businesses lose $2K-10K/month on missed calls.

We built a simple platform to make that invisible money visible.

### Email 3 (Day 10, No Response)
**Subject:** One Last Try: Let me Show You in 15 Minutes

```
Hi [Name],

I promise this is my last email. 😊

Most people don't respond to cold emails. No judgment.

But if you do have 15 minutes, I can show you exactly how much revenue [Company] might be leaving on the table.

No pitch. Just real numbers.

## SEQUENCE 5: Tier Upsell (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3)

### Trigger: 30 days on Tier 1

### Email 1
**Subject:** You've Been on Tier 1 for 30 Days. Here's What You're Missing 📊

```
Hi [Name],

You're tracking [X] calls/month. Great!

But here's what we notice:
• You're still manually logging deals
• No automated follow-up for missed calls
• Team members can't see all calls
• No booking integration

**With Tier 2 ($2,000/mo):**
You add automation + collaboration + booking.

Most Tier 1 customers upgrade to Tier 2 within 60 days because the manual work gets old fast.

Ready to level up? [Upgrade to Tier 2]

## How to Implement

### Option 1: Zapier (No Code)
1. Create Zap: "Form Submission" → "Send Email (Gmail)"
2. Set up trigger: Landing page form → Zapier webhook
3. Create automation rules for delays (Day 2, Day 5, etc.)
4. Test with real submissions

### Option 2: Make.com
Similar to Zapier, with more flexibility for complex workflows.

### Option 3: Custom Backend (API)
Use SendGrid API + Node.js to send emails based on timing and user actions.

### Tracking
Add UTM parameters to all links:
- `?utm_source=email&utm_campaign=trial_day2`
- `?utm_source=email&utm_campaign=demo_followup`

This lets you see which emails drive signups and conversions.

---

## SMS Notes

- Use Twilio API or Zapier for SMS sending
- Keep messages short (<160 characters = 1 SMS)
- Always include opt-out ("Reply STOP to unsubscribe")
- Best times: 9-11am, 2-4pm (when people check phones)
- Avoid nights/weekends unless urgent

---

## Email Deliverability Tips

- Use branded domain (notifications@revenuelock.com, not Gmail)
- Add SPF/DKIM records
- Include unsubscribe link (required by law)
- Don't send from no-reply address (use real person name)
- Test subject lines on {free tools}
- Warm up domain before high-volume sends

---

## Metrics to Track

- **Open rate** (target: >25%)
- **Click rate** (target: >5%)
- **Reply rate** (target: >2% for cold outreach)
- **Conversion rate** (form submission or calendar book)
- **Unsubscribe rate** (should be <0.5%)

Adjust sequences based on data. If a subject line gets 40% opens, use that template for others.
