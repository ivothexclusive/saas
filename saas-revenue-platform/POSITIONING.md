## Tone & Voice

**Professional but not corporate.** Direct. Specific. ROI-focused.

- ✅ Use data: "40% increase," "$4K/month recovered," "10+ hours saved"
- ✅ Use their language: "calls," "deals," "leads," "revenue"
- ✅ Avoid tech jargon: No "AI-powered ML algorithms"
- ✅ Focus on outcomes: "More money. Less work."
- ✅ Be specific about segments: "HVAC owners, not 'entrepreneurs'"

---

## Key Differentiators

**Why us, not competitors?**

1. **All-in-one:** Not just call tracking (Aircall, JustCall) or CRM (Salesforce)—complete revenue platform
2. **Built for simplicity:** Competitor tools are enterprise-complex; ours is 5-50 person team friendly
3. **Revenue-focused:** We show $$ impact, not vanity metrics
4. **Done-for-you option:** We can set it up AND optimize for you (DFY component)
5. **AI that works:** Tier 3 includes predictive scoring, smart routing, auto-optimization

---

## Objection Handlers

**"Can't I just use Salesforce + Aircall + Zapier?"**
> "You could. But you'd spend 20+ hours integrating, maintaining, and training staff on 3 different tools. We handle all of that. Customers usually go from 'tech headache' to 'working in 2 hours.'"

**"What if we already have a CRM?"**
> "Perfect. We integrate with Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive. You keep your CRM; we handle calls + follow-up + revenue attribution."

**"How long until we see ROI?"**
> "Day 1: You see how many calls you're actually getting. Week 1: You see revenue impact. Week 2-4: Automation saves time and money. Most recover their investment in month 1."

**"Isn't this expensive for a small business?"**
> "Not when you're tracking revenue. One recovered deal (~$1K-5K) pays for months of service. Customers typically recover $2K-10K in month 1 alone."

## Messaging Hierarchy

**Primary message:** "See your real revenue impact"
**Secondary message:** "Automate follow-up and booking"
**Tertiary message:** "AI-powered optimization"

(Lead with primary. Use secondary for mid-funnel. Save AI for Tier 3 upsell.)
