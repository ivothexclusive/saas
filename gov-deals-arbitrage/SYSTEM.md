## High-Margin Items to Target

### Sanitizers & Cleaning (70-90% margin potential)
- Purell hand sanitizer (any size)
- Lysol disinfectant spray
- Clorox wipes
- Disinfectant concentrate
- N95 masks
- Nitrile gloves
- Hand soap dispensers

**Why:** COVID restocking + ongoing demand. Government often sells below wholesale.

### Technology (40-60% margin potential)
- Laptops (Dell, HP, Lenovo, ThinkPad)
- Monitors (27"+)
- Tablets (iPad, Samsung)
- Networking gear (routers, switches, firewalls)
- Servers (if you have volume)
- Desktop computers (business-grade)
- Phone systems/VoIP equipment

**Why:** Government buys enterprise-grade, sells at 30-50% of new retail.

### Office Equipment (30-50% margin)
- Office chairs (high-end ergonomic)
- Desks & filing cabinets
- Printers & scanners
- Copiers (multifunction)
- Shredders

**Why:** Remote work boom = demand for used office furniture.

### Consumer/Other (40-70% margin)
- Tools (power tools, hand tools)
- Appliances (refrigerators, microwaves)
- Furniture (all types)
- Clothing/outdoor gear
- Sporting equipment
- HVAC equipment

## Profitability Calculation

### Example 1: Purell Hand Sanitizer
```
Auction price: $500 for case of 12 bottles
Per unit: $500 ÷ 12 = $41.67

Amazon selling price: $8-12 per bottle (typical)
Let's say $10/bottle average
Revenue: 12 × $10 = $120

Shipping to FBA: ~$3/bottle = $36 total
Amazon fees: ~30% = $36
Profit: $120 - $41.67 - $36 - $36 = $6.33 per unit = $76 total

NOT GREAT. But if you find lots at $200/case:
Profit per case: $120 - $16.67 - $36 - $36 = $31.33 ✅ GOOD
```

### Example 2: Laptop
```
Auction price: $400 for refurb Dell XPS 13
Condition: "Good" (cosmetic wear, fully functional)

Amazon selling price: $800-1000 for same model
Let's say $900

Shipping: $30
Amazon fees: ~15% = $135
Refurbishment (if needed): $0-100

Profit: $900 - $400 - $30 - $135 = $335 ✅ EXCELLENT
```

## Important Notes

### Shipping
- Government auctions: Buyer pays shipping
- Some items: Free local pickup (cheaper!)
- Consider shipping cost in margin calculation

### Condition
- "As-is" → Research condition carefully
- "Good" = Cosmetic wear, fully functional
- "Excellent" = Like new
- "Fair" = Works but visible damage (may not sell on Amazon)

### Amazon FBA Restrictions
- Some items banned (aerosols, hazardous)
- Sanitizer sprays: Check restrictions (may be FBA-restricted)
- Liquids: Extra fees
- Electronics: Condition-dependent

### Profitability Reality
- **Sanitizers:** Better margins if buying in massive bulk
- **Tech:** Best margins (often 40-60%)
- **Furniture:** Heavy (shipping kills margin)
- **Tools:** Good margins (25-45%)

## Expected Timeline

**Week 1:** Set up accounts, find 3-5 deals, place bids
**Week 2:** Win first auction(s), receive inventory
**Week 3:** List on Amazon, start getting sales
**Week 4+:** Reinvest profits, scale up

**Monthly revenue potential:** $1K-5K depending on capital + deal quality

## Next Steps

I'll build:
1. **Automated daily scanner** (checks all 5 databases)
2. **Profitability calculator** (auction price → Amazon margin)
3. **Alert dashboard** (notifies you of good deals)
4. **Bid tracker** (what you're winning/losing)

Once you confirm, I'll have it ready in 2-3 days.

**Questions before I build:**
1. Starting capital? ($1K? $5K? $10K?)
2. Focus area first? (Sanitizers, Tech, All?)
3. Amazon seller account ready? (Or do you need help setting up?)
